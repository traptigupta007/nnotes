<strong>Definition - What does C Programming Language (C) mean?</strong></br></br>
C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System in the early 1970s.
</br></br>
Ranked among the most widely used languages, C has a compiler for most computer systems and has influenced many popular languages – notably C++.
<p class="paragraph"> 
<strong>Techopedia explains C Programming Language (C)</strong></br></br>
C belongs to the structured, procedural paradigms of languages. It is proven, flexible and powerful and may be used for a variety of different applications. Although high level, C and assembly language share many of the same attributes.</br></br>
Some of C's most important features include:</br></br>
1. Fixed number of keywords, including a set of control primitives, such as if, for, while, switch and do while</br></br>
2. Multiple logical and mathematical operators, including bit manipulators</br></br>
3. Multiple assignments may be applied in a single statement.</br></br>
4. Function return values are not always required and may be ignored if unneeded.</br></br>
5. Typing is static. All data has type but may be implicitly converted.</br></br>
6. Basic form of modularity, as files may be separately compiled and linked</br></br>
7. Control of function and object visibility to other files via extern and static attributes</br></br>

<strong>If statements in C</strong></br></br>
The ability to control the flow of your program, letting it make decisions on what code to execute, is valuable to the programmer. The if statement allows you to control if a program enters a section of code or not based on whether a given condition is true or false. One of the important functions of the if statement is that it allows the program to select an action based upon the user's input. For example, by using an if statement to check a user-entered password, your program can decide whether a user is allowed access to the program. </br>
Without a conditional statement such as the if statement, programs would run almost the exact same way every time, always following the same sequence of function calls. If statements allow the flow of the program to be changed, which leads to more interesting code.</br> 

Before discussing the actual structure of the if statement, let us examine the meaning of TRUE and FALSE in computer terminology. A true statement is one that evaluates to a nonzero number. A false statement evaluates to zero. When you perform comparison with the relational operators, the operator will return 1 if the comparison is true, or 0 if the comparison is false. <strong>For example</strong>, the check 0 == 2 evaluates to 0. The check 2 == 2 evaluates to a 1. If this confuses you, try to use a printf statement to output the result of those various comparisons (for example printf ( "%d", 2 == 1 );) </br>

When programming, the aim of the program will often require the checking of one value stored by a variable against another value to determine whether one is larger, smaller, or equal to the other.</br> 

There are a number of operators that allow these checks. </br>

<strong>Definition - What does C++ Programming Language mean?</strong></br></br>
C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.</br></br>

C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called "C with classes" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of "classes." However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.</br></br>It is pronounced "see-plus-plus."
<p class="paragraph"> 
<strong>Techopedia explains C++ Programming Language</strong></br></br>
C++ is one of the most popular languages primarily utilized with system/application software, drivers, client-server applications and embedded firmware.</br></br>
The main highlight of C++ is a collection of predefined classes, which are data types that can be instantiated multiple times. The language also facilitates declaration of user-defined classes. Classes can further accommodate member functions to implement specific functionality. Multiple objects of a particular class can be defined to implement the functions within the class. Objects can be defined as instances created at run time. These classes can also be inherited by other new classes which take in the public and protected functionalities by default.</br></br>
C++ includes several operators such as comparison, arithmetic, bit manipulation and logical operators. One of the most attractive features of C++ is that it enables the overloading of certain operators such as addition.</br></br>
A few of the essential concepts within the C++ programming language include polymorphism, virtual and friend functions, templates, namespaces and pointers.
