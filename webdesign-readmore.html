<strong>What is website design?</strong></br></br>
Briefly, website design means planning, creation and updating of websites. Website design also involves information architecture, website structure, user interface, navigation ergonomics, website layout, colors, contrasts, fonts and imagery (photography) as well as icons design.
</br></br>
All these website elements combined together form websites. Often, the meaning of "design" is perceived solely as a visual aspect. In reality, website  design includes more abstract elements such as usability, ergonomics, layout traditions, user habits, navigation logic and other things that simplify the using of websites and help to find information faster.
<p class="paragraph"> 
Sometimes the technical side of website design is emphasized in the definition of design. Surely, the modern website building involves server side scripting like php, asp and cgi, websites' visual side is defined with html and css, user experience is enhanced with dynamic javascript and ajax. When talking to people with poor technical knowledge, instead of speaking about technical details, we concentrate on functionalities, e. g. to what extent it is possible to update a website through content management system and which features are visible to users.</br></br>
In classical terms, design describes the visual appearance of a website. Traditional approach involves contrast, coloring, balance, emphasis, rhythm, style of graphical elements (lines, shapes, texture, color and direction), use of icons, background textures and general atmosphere of overall website design. </br></br> 
All these elements are combined with the fundamental principles of design in order to create a superb result that meets the goals set for the website.
